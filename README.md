## Audio-Visual Event (AVE) Localization task
AVE localization aims to find out those video segments containing an *audio-visual event* and classify its category.
An *audio-visual* event is both audible and visible, which means the sound source must appear in visual image (visible) while the sound it makes also exists in audio portion (audible).

## Data preparation
The AVE dataset and the extracted audio and visual features can be downloaded from [https://github.com/YapengTian/AVE-ECCV18](https://github.com/YapengTian/AVE-ECCV18).
Other preprocessed files used in this repository can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q8GYBqfkyDDAnVMClrMTXR9YzH9UPcSM?usp=sharing).
All the required data are listed as below, and these files should be placed into the ``data`` folder.
<pre><code>
audio_feature.h5  visual_feature.h5  audio_feature_noisy.h5 visual_feature_noisy.h5
right_label.h5  prob_label.h5  labels_noisy.h5  mil_labels.h5
train_order.h5  val_order.h5  test_order.h5
</code></pre>


## Fully supervised setting
- Train:
>  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python fully_supervised_main.py --model_name PSP --threshold=0.099 --train
- Test:
>  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python fully_supervised_main.py --model_name PSP --threshold=0.099 --trained_model_path ./model/PSP_fully.pt

## Weakly supervised setting
- Train:
> CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python weakly_supervised_main.py --model_name PSP --threshold=0.095 --train
- Test:
> CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python weakly_supervised_main.py --model_name PSP --threshold=0.095 --trained_model_path ./model/PSP_weakly.pt

**Note:** The pre-trained models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YEyEH6e988v1NUwwVYohrwY2DSpVtVoT?usp=sharing) and they should be placed into the ``model`` folder. If you would like to train from scratch for the both settings, you may make some adjustments to further improve the performance (e.g., try another threshold value, choose a different initialization method and so on).
